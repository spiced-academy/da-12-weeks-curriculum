## Project Description

The US authorities have registered the names of all US citizens born since 1880. The record is publicly available. For data protection reasons, only names that have been used at least 5 times are listed in the data record.

##### üéØ Goal: Design, implement and present a visualization using the baby names dataset

- **Define Questions**
    - Example questions will be given
    - Students can develop own questions
- **Identify Data Sources**
    - text files downloaded from internet
- **Retrieve Data**
    - Read in text file(s) using pandas
- **Data Wrangling, Exploration and Cleaning**
    - Solve the one-liner challenges
    - Aggregate several datasets together
- **Analyze Data**
    - Simple metrics
- **Present Data to Stakeholders**
    - Create explanatory plots of the data
    - Plot the timeline of baby name(s)
    - Develop and present your own visualization


! Data Anonymization

*Even if you have ‚Äúnothing to hide,‚Äù in the wrong hands, this knowledge makes you more exploitable* said [Tyler Elliot Bettilyon](https://www.tebs-lab.com/about) in his [Why ‚ÄòAnonymized Data‚Äô Isn‚Äôt So Anonymous](https://onezero.medium.com/why-anonymized-data-isn-t-so-anonymous-535d2db75a2d) article. 
Why do you think not including the names that appeared at least 5 times in a year was mentioned as a data protection step?
