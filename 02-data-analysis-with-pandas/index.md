*Even if you have ‚Äúnothing to hide,‚Äù in the wrong hands, this knowledge makes you more exploitable* said [Tyler Elliot Bettilyon](https://www.tebs-lab.com/about) in his [Why ‚ÄòAnonymized Data‚Äô Isn‚Äôt So Anonymous](https://onezero.medium.com/why-anonymized-data-isn-t-so-anonymous-535d2db75a2d) article. 
Why do you think not including the names that appeared at least 5 times in a year was mentioned as a data protection step?
