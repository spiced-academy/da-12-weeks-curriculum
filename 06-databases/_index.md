# Project: Movie Database


The board of governors at the Oscars think that the Oscars has looked over many great films in the past due to zeitgeist among other things. They have commissioned you to look over the historical data from various movies in order to correct the past. They wish for you to do this using not only the data from the movies but also some rating that users have given capturing the zeitgeist of modern times. 

This week you will set up and connect to a database full of movies in the cloud. You will learn to use SQL to explore this data and also learn how to model data in a relational database.
