## How to find a job you love

How to create an effective job search strategy as well as creating a strong application portfolio will be discussed. 

## HR Interview & Salary

There will be a session on interviewing, both behavioral and technical, and also how to handle salary negotiations will be covered.

## Technical Interviews

During this week you will get the opportunity to work on a technical challenge that you might encounter if you apply for a data analyst position. 

If you are upskilling this challenge could also be useful as it acts as a revision for the material cover in weeks one to six of your course. Alternatively, if you have data of your own that you would like to analyse and then present this is also possible. 

## Presentation Skills

During week 8 we will work on presentation skills allowing you to become a strong communicator and deliver your message to a group in a compelling way. 

At the end of the week we will finish presentations, allowing you to combine your new improved presentation skills with your work on the technical challenge (or data of your choice).
