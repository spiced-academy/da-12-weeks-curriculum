## Inspiration / goal
We will create the second of the KPI dashboards:

- **KPIs by Categories and States Dashboard**

## Sets

[Set](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/sortgroup_sets_create.htm) is a great option for creating a group based on a condition. If you create a set it will appear in your Data section with an icon of two rings intersecting each other. 
Examples of the usage:
- a set representing N best groups of data given a condition, e.g. 10 most highly rated movies
- a set representing all the stores that generated positive profit
- a combined set using previously created sets, where the matching condition are similar to the joins available in SQL
