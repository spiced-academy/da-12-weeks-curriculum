{{% /notice %}}

## Self-test

### Easy

You have the following variable:


```bash
In [1]: code = 684
```

Multiply this number by 10, substract 1, and divide by 7. As a result, you obtain the number of babies having the name "Walter" in 2014.


### Medium

You have the following variable:

```bash
In [1]: name = "Walter White"
```

Extract both initials from the string and store them to a new variable.


### Hard

Store the following three lines in three separate string variables. Then concatenate them to one variable:

```txt
In the year 2014

977 Babys having the name 'Walter'

were born in the U.S.
```
