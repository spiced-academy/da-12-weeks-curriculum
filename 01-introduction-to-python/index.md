# Project: Text-Adventure

![](https://www.academis.eu/static/content/games_EN/dragon_egg.png)

Far, far away, in an hardly accessible landscape, the mighty Data Medal lies hidden.
Will you find the Medal and unlock the Power of Data Analytics?

- the medal can be found on a lonely clearing
- to unlock the medal, you need a magic spell
- the spell is only known to a mage
- the mage lives in a tower behind the forest
- in the forest lives a bear that doesn't let anyone pass
- the bear, however, loves honey. Fortunately there is a beekeeper nearby.

OK, this is not the greatest plot ever written. If you have a better one, program it!

##### ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Implement and present a working text adventure game in which you can travel around between multiple rooms

- the game is entirely text-based
- the 'world' should consist of at least four "rooms" (clearing, tower, forest etc.)
- every room has a description
- you enter the room to which you want to go on the keyboard
- when you find "the medal", the game ends with a final message
- present your game in a lightning talk

It is not easy to place all statements in the right order. A good idea is to run the program after each modification and to see what happens.

For sure you have many ideas what to include in your adventure.
