accessible data visualizations to explain global development and global issues.

## Project Challenge

{{% notice challenge "Set up Project Environment" %}}

Please follow the steps listed below to get started:

1. Create a folder and name it appropriately. For example `03_week`
2. Inside the new folder create two more folders and name them: `notebooks` and `data` 

The resulting folder structure will look like this:

```shell
03_week
      â”œâ”€â”€ data
      â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks
      â””â”€â”€ weekly_project_notebooks
```

**Note:** Save all datasets in the data folder. Many will be used throughout the week for different exercises and challenges. Keeping them all in one place helps find them easily and prevents having redundant duplicates on your computer.
