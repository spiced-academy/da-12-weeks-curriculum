Take a look at the two Tables above:


1. Try to count the number 4 on both tables
2. On which table it is easy to count 4s and why?
3. What is helping the information to stands out more?

## Dashboards
In this encounter we go over where dashboards sit within our toolset as a data analyst and why they are powerful tools. 

### What is our role as designers of dashboards?

There are different communication tools such as **slides** which are great way to present infos, static and easy to create but not interactive, **reports** which are mostly static and having the risk of having too much text/loosing the audience. As a data analyst our role is look at the data and interpret data into meaningful summaries and data visualization is a powerful way to help you do this. We need to communicate our findings to the wider business and particularly team members who can take action.  **Dashboards** are the most powerful communication tools for data analysts. They are visual reports designed to offer a comprehensive overview.

Dashboards: 
- can be automatically updated
- are interactive

There are different tools that you can use to create dashboards such as Tableau, Google Data Studio, PowerBI.

In the upcoming weeks we will focus on one of these tools, Tableau, and talk about the story telling. Tableau is a very powerful data visualisation tool. However, it is in the high cost range. As data analyst it is important to have the knowledge about the different tools to create dashboards to be able to create fast solutions. Therefore, this week we are focusing on Dash which is a wonderful library framework all in python that allows you to build interactive web application dashboards.


## Exercises:

### Task 1:
If you make a simple research on product design, you will encounter many different principles for product design list. We also use many of those principles for dashboard creation. Try to understand the 4A principles of product design and brainstorm with your team mate about how we can apply these principles in dashboard design and why are they important:

1. Affordance: It should be clear, how the product should be used.
2. Accessibility: In the context of the design of a building, it would be wheelchair access.
3. Aesthetics: They are more readily to accepted.
4. Acceptance: A product must satisfy in order to be accepted by a stakeholder.

### Task 2:
Brainstorm with your team mates about the things to consider in order to make a powerful dashboard. Share your findings with the class. 


## Making Interactive Dashboards
Slider, checkbox, date picker, dropdown are components that you might want to use in order to create the interactive capability inside your dashboards.



## Project Challenges

1. Go to [dash gallery](https://dash.gallery/Portal/)
2. Check some dashboards which you think followed the principles we explained before. Are any of the dashboards violating the principles?
3. Try to figure out which features you see in the dashboards and what is their usage?
4. Go to your terminal and `pip install dash`
