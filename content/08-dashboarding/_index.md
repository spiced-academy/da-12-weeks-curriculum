##### ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal: Design and deploy a web app with using dash

In this week, you learn how to design *interactive charts and maps* and how to create an interactive web app with using dash and deploying it with render!

The next days, you will continue working with weather data which contains daily temperature
records from hundreds of weather stations from different locations.

- **Define Questions**
  - Example questions will be given
  - Students can develop own questions
- **Identify Data Sources**
  - Use the processed weather data you worked with during the analytical engineering week
- **Retrieve Data**
  - Using sqlalchemy get the datamarts you created during the analytical engineering week
- **Data Wrangling, Exploration and Cleaning**
  - Create dataframes out of the datamarts
  - Filter the dataframes for the graphs you decided to create for your dashboard
- **Analyze Data**
  - Use interactive visualizations to analyze data
- **Present Data to Stakeholders**
  - Create interactive temperature bar plots for different locations using `plotly` 
  - Create an interactive climate map with `plotly`
  - Create a web app using dash
  - Integrate these interactive visuals into dash
  - Deploy the dash app to share it via link
