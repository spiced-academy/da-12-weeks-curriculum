⏱ Timing
---------

-  ⏱ Your demo should be in the range of 7 to 10 minutes followed by Q&A. 10 min MAX. Do not go over the time limit. An alarm will sound.
-  🛑 Stop working on your project early enough. You will ALWAYS feel like you can do more. That's coding.
-  Perhaps this is just a prototype for a much larger project!

Structure
---------

-  💼 Please start your demo by saying your name, the name of your project and a very brief plain-English description of what your project is about.
-  Start with **why** – a problem questions
-  Write down a central statement in one short sentence
-  Structure – 3-4 main points is sufficient
-  You don't need to talk about everything you did - pick the best parts
-  Work with *"before/after"* of *"A vs B"* effects


Make the content interesting
----------------------------

-  💻 Say something about your TECH STACK (e.g. I used Python, NumPy, PostGres...)
-  🚫 AVOID showing raw code / Jupyter Notebook!!! Having some little screenshots of code snippets / functions every now and then for context is great, but nobody wants to see you run Jupyter Notebook cells during your demo. (Show <= 10 lines of code at a time)
-  🔢 📖 Show some raw numbers (how many data points, calculation time etc.)
-  round numbers to two digits, unless you can credibly prove a point about!
-  The audience loves stories, mishaps, basics, funny details.
-  are there any interesting data points (outliers, mispredictions) worth talking about?

Slides
------

-  🖼 You can use slides if you want give a brief background to your project, but the focus is on what you built and/or what are your results.
-  One slide/min. is maximum, preferably less. 
-  You may choose not to use slides at all and focus on demoing your program
-  One image, four points max. per slide
-  One diagram per slide is enough

Live Demos
----------

-  Obviously, running finished software (e.g. python script in the terminal, or a web app) for a live demo is different, as this is a finished product and part of your presentation.
-  ⚙️ Please demo only working software. (you CAN, however -- and are encouraged to -- talk about future improvements and lessons learned.)
-  🗣 Speaking of Live Demos: It's a great idea if it works, so please make sure that your code is tested / won't mess up if there's bad WiFi or something.
-  **HAVE A BACKUP IN CASE IT FAILS LIVE.** (video, PDF or similar)
-  🔌 During the week of the final project, do a TECH CHECK!! (e.g. HDMI cable, etc.0)


On Stage
--------

-  do not apologize
-  don't talk about things you weren't able to finish
-  🙊 If you make a mistake, it's no problem. Most often, the audience doesn't know that you've made a mistake.
-  You can start over or make a joke out of it (if you are comfortable with humor) or just keep going!
-  When speaking, focus on showing off the features that work, rather than being apologetic about features that you wish you had built but didn't due to lack of time.
-  ⁉️ After your demo, please expect questions from the audience.
-  If you are not sure of the answer, say that you don't know and that's about it.
-  While presenting, please remember to be loud, confident in your voice and upbeat.
-  Wear something comfortable and professional.


**👏 You have worked so hard for this -- not everyone goes through an intensive 9-week coding bootcamp and sees it through to the end! Be proud of your work!**
