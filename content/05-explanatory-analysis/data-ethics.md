{{% notice warmup "Privilege and Opression" %}}

When talking about data we can't forget about the topic of privilege and oppression that is also visible in datasets and solutions (algorithms and models) based on data.

How priviliged are we and how it affects our work?

## Data Ethics

Data ethics is a branch of ethics that evaluates practices connected with data such as collecting, generating, analysing and disseminating data and it is about both structured and unstructured data. As these actions have the potential to adversely impact people and society, data ethics includes addressing and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. It involves the conversations about transparency and defensibility of actions and decisions made by automated/artificial intelligence (AI) in relation to data in general and personal data in particular.


### Data Feminism

[Data Feminism by Catherine d'Ignazio and Lauren Klein](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/) introduces the topic of intersecticting the ideas of both data science and data ethics with intersectional feminism. Their book is fully available online. Even though it talks a lot about Data Science, the whole topic is relevant to all the areas connected to working with data and Data Analytics to major extent.
