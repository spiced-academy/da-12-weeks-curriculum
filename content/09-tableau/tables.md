## Inspiration / goal
We will improve the one of the dashboards:

- **Sales vs Profit for Categories Discovery Dashboard**

And create the last discovery dashboard:

- **Sales vs Profit in Time Discovery Dashboard**

## Tables
[Tables](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/buildexamples_text.htm) are also quite a common visualization type in Tableau. 

## Table calculations
[Table calculations](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/calculations_tablecalculations.htm) is a functionality enabling different kinds of comparison between datapoints, as for example seeing the growth of a metric in your table over the time.
To give an example, it could be used to:
- come up with rankings
- calculate running average
- calculate the relative difference between defined groups of data
- prepare a cohort analysis

The direction of the calculations can also be defined by yourself.


## Hierarchies 
Parts of your data might be organized in [hierarchies](https://help.tableau.com/current/pro/desktop/en-us/qs_hierarchies.htm) - it might make sense to link together dimensions such as category, sub-category, product name, ... If we have a hierarchy in place, it enables us to easily move between different levels of aggregation of the results.
