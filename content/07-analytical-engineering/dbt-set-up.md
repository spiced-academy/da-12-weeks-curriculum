## What is `dbt`?
`dbt` (data build tool) is a tool that allows you to easily build and maintain data pipelines and data warehouses. Recently it gained more and more popularity as it bridges the gap between data engineering and data analytics and subsequently enabling the emergence of analytics engineering as a field.

There are two major data integration processes used in data pipelines, called *ETL* and *ELT*. The key difference between both lies in the order of operations. 

- In **ETL**, the data is first extracted from the source system, then transformed and finally loaded into the data warehouse. 
- While in **ELT**, the data is extracted from the source system, loaded into the data warehouse and transformed afterwards. So in contrast to ETL, upon arrival in the data warehouse, the data is still raw. 

`dbt` is commonly used in the transformation part of **ELT** because it facilitates the creation and maintenance of data transformations in a way that is testable and version controlled. Hence it allows you to transform and analyze your data in a structured and documentable way, while tailoring it to your client's needs.

## Why `dbt`?
There are a lot of reasons why you should use `dbt` where some of them are mentioned below:
- It is open source and free to use
- It is very easy to *use*. You can start using it in a few minutes
- It is very easy to *test*. You can easily test your models
- It is very easy to *document*. You can easily document your models
- It is very easy to *version control*. You can easily version control your models
- It is very easy to *deploy*. You can easily deploy your models to different environments
- It is very easy to *automate*. You can easily automate your models
- It is very easy to *integrate*. You can easily integrate it with other tools
- It is very easy to *maintain*. You can easily maintain your models

## How does `dbt` work?
`dbt` is basically adding a modeling layer to the data warehouse. We get the raw data and run it through dbt models. Each dbt model is a `.sql` file which is depending either on the raw data or on other dbt models. The output of the dbt models is then stored in the data warehouse as views or tables.

In a standard `dbt` project you have the following layers:

- raw data
- staging models: where you can clean the data (rename columns, remove duplicates, etc.)
- prep models: where you can aggregate the data (sum, count, etc.)
- analysis models or mart models: where you can analyze the data (calculate the average, etc.)

These mart models often are seperated by stakeholder groups. So you have mart models for the marketing team, mart models for the sales team, etc. and they are organized in different folders and in different schemas within the data warehouse.

## `dbt` repositories

One of the `dbt` aims is to create a flow where your work will be version controlled. That's why all the code that `dbt` will need to model the data has to be a part of a repository. In the project challenges you will see that you will need to create a new github repository that will follow this structure:
- `dbt_project.yml` - defines the project and global variables/paths
- `dbt_packages` - used if any external packages are used (same like pandas in python)
- `logs` - logs of all `dbt` runs
- `macros` - will store the code that might be repeated (like a function in python)
- `models`:
   - `staging` — creating our atoms, our initial modular building blocks, from source data
   - `prep` (intermediate) — stacking layers of logic with clear and specific purposes to prepare our staging models to join into the entities we want 
   - `marts` — bringing together our modular pieces into a wide, rich vision of the entities our organization cares about - for the stakeholers
- `seeds` — seeds are CSV files in your `dbt` project (typically in your seeds directory), that `dbt` can load into your data warehouse using the `dbt seed` command
- `snapshots` — analysts often need to "look back in time" at previous data states in their mutable tables. While some source data systems are built in a way that makes accessing historical data possible, this is not always the case. `dbt` provides a mechanism, snapshots, which records changes to a mutable table over time
- `target` — where the compiled SQL code is saved
- `tests` — tests are assertions you make about your models and other resources in your `dbt` project (e.g. sources, seeds and snapshots). When you run `dbt test`, `dbt` will tell you if each test in your project passes or fails.

## `dbt core` and `dbt cloud`
There are two ways of using `dbt`. 
1. **dbt Core:** An open-source project. It’s free to use, but it requires technical knowledge as you have to set it up locally on your computer.
2. **dbt Cloud:** A commercial product. `dbt cloud` is basically `dbt` core with a lot of additional out-of-the-box features like job orchestration, which you would have to do on your own in the open-source version.  
   
In our week we will use the beginner-friendly `dbt cloud`.

We will need a repository with the codebase for data modeling / data pipeline:
