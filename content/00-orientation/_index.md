# Overview of the Curriculum

<i class="fas fa-rocket"></i> In the **first week**, you start learning Python programming from scratch. You will write your own programs in order to get familiar with your developmental environment. You learn how to structure your program and folder architecture.

<i class="fas fa-table"></i> In **weeks 2-5**, you will use the pandas library, Pythons #1 tool to analyze tabular data. Using your knowledge from the previous weeks, you will learn to explore data and create attractive visualizations rapidly. You will learn how to deal with missing and messy data. You will also have a chance to see how Machine Learning works and do a bit more deep dive into statistics.

<i class="fas fa-database"></i> In **weeks 6 and 7**, you will tap into bigger data sources: SQL databases. You will create your own relational cloud database using Google Cloud and Postgres. You will populate it with data, work your way from basic SQL queries over aggregations and joint tables to advanced query logic with subqueries and use index structures to speed up your search. You will read the data into Python and create interactive visualizations and maps. The second week of databases will be more engineering oriented with dbt and data modeling elements.

<i class="fas fa-columns"></i> In **weeks 8 and 9**, you will play with dashboarding. In the first week you're gonna keep using python and related tools to build your own dashboard and in the second week you will use Tableau, a state-of-the-art dashboarding tool to tap into a database and translate data into appealing visual insights. You will discuss pros and cons of data visualization and critically assess common statistical pitfalls.

<i class="fas fa-users"></i> In **week 10**, you will develop soft skills that allow you to perform well in your future career. You will learn about the different stages of team development and practice strategies for dealing with conflict within teams. By solving a real interview coding challenge, you will recap the things learned in the previous weeks. 

<i class="fas fa-user-graduate"></i> In the **2 final weeks** of the project, you will develop your own data project and present it at the Graduation.
