{{% expand "Do I have to complete every task in the course material?" %}}

You have to complete at least 80% of challenges related to each of the weekly projects (the ones in the blue boxes). If you want to do sth that is not exactly the solution of the challenges but similar it's okay as long it's an equivalent of suggested work. In such a case talk to us to agree on your learning path.

Besides the project challenges, you will find extra tasks and additional links in the course materials. Treat it as brain food for further learning.

{{% expand "Are we allowed to copy solutions we find online??" %}}

Yes, but you MUST state clearly where you took the code from.


{{% notice tip %}}

Solving a task by copy-pasting a complete solution does not teach you anything. A good strategy would be to first develop your own solution and then compare it to what others did. This is a nice way to present a project.
